## Description

![Intro Pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36535914/88682655-94339a80-d0fb-11ea-8411-b838ce55d391.jpg) <br>

In this project, ISPARK - Istanbul Park, municipally driven car park company, data has used to analyze Istanbul car park network including parking point cost, usage and location. <br>

From that reason, I try to find out the answers of below questions during the project: <br> 
- How many parking zones do each side of Istanbul have? What is the average monthly subscription cost per side? <br>
- What are the number of parking zones and their monthly costs of each district in Istanbul ? <br>
- What is the average utilization rate and total capacity of parking zones of each district in Istanbul ? <br>
- What are the parking slots that we can stop 15 minutes (or more) freely ? <br>
        
The findings can be found at the post available here in Medium
